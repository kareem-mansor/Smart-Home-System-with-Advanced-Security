# Smart Home with Advanced Security using Face Recognition & Embedded Systems 🔐

## 📌 Project Overview
This project integrates **Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning** to create a **Smart Home System with Advanced Security**. The system ensures that only authorized individuals can control the home environment through **Face Recognition-Based Access** and a **backup password system**. 

## 🌟 Key Features
✅ **Face Recognition-Based Access**: The system activates only if a recognized face is detected from a pre-stored database, enhancing security.
✅ **Embedded System Automation**: Built using a **PIC16F877A microcontroller**, LCD display, LEDs, and motor control for a secure **door locking mechanism**.
✅ **Password-Based Security Layer**: A backup password system ensures controlled access if face recognition is unavailable.
✅ **LCD Feedback & Real-Time Control**: The system displays real-time status updates on an LCD, providing a user-friendly interface.
✅ **Scalability & Future Enhancements**: Future expansions can include **IoT integration, remote monitoring, and voice assistant control**.
